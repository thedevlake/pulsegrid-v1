- Human-readable predictions and recommendations

#### Infrastructure & Deployment

- Deployed to AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, S3 for frontend)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Automated health check scheduling via AWS EventBridge and Lambda

  **Public API**

- Rate-limited public status check endpoint
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification documentation

### Partially Implemented

⚠️ **PDF Reports**: Endpoint exists but returns "not implemented" message (CSV export works)  
⚠️ **Load Balancer**: Network Load Balancer configured but not actively routing traffic (system uses direct ECS task IPs)

## 🤖 How AI Predictions Work

The prediction system uses a two-stage approach:

1. **Statistical Analysis** (Always performed):

   - Calculates failure rates from historical health checks
   - Analyzes response time trends (increasing/decreasing/stable)
   - Detects anomalies using standard deviation analysis
   - Determines risk levels (low/medium/high/critical) and confidence scores
   - Identifies status change patterns

2. **AI Enhancement** (Optional, if OpenAI API key or Ollama is configured):
   - Takes the statistical analysis results
   - Sends aggregated metrics to the configured AI provider (OpenAI or Ollama) with a structured prompt
   - AI generates human-readable descriptions of:
     - Predicted issue (what might go wrong)
     - Reason (why this prediction was made)
     - Recommended action (what to do about it)
   - Falls back to rule-based descriptions if AI is unavailable

**Note**: The system works without AI - it performs statistical analysis and provides predictions. AI is used to make the output more readable and actionable, not to perform the actual analysis.

### AI Provider Options

PulseGrid supports two AI providers for natural language predictions:

1. **Ollama** (Recommended): Self-hosted AI model running as a sidecar container in ECS

   - No API costs
   - Runs locally in your infrastructure
   - Configured via `OLLAMA_ENABLED`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `OLLAMA_MODEL` environment variables
   - Model is automatically pulled on container startup

2. **OpenAI** (Alternative): Cloud-based AI service
   - Requires API key configuration
   - Pay-per-use pricing
   - Configured via `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

The system prioritizes Ollama if enabled, otherwise falls back to OpenAI. If neither is configured, predictions use statistical analysis with rule-based descriptions.

### Configuring AI Providers

#### Option 1: Ollama (Recommended)

Ollama is configured via Terraform variables and runs as a sidecar container:

1. Set `ollama_enabled = true` in `terraform.tfvars`
2. Optionally set `ollama_model` (default: "llama2")
3. Apply Terraform to deploy Ollama container alongside backend
4. The model will be automatically pulled on first startup

See [OLLAMA_SETUP.md](OLLAMA_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

#### Option 2: OpenAI

1. Copy `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars.example` to `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars` and add your real `openai_api_key` (keep this file out of version control).
2. Apply Terraform so the key is written to SSM Parameter Store (`/pulsegrid/openai/api_key`).
3. After rotating the key, update the parameter at any time with:

```bash
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1 ./scripts/update-openai-key.sh sk-your-key
# Redeploy the backend task so the new key is injected
```

If the key is missing or invalid, the API logs will show `OpenAI prediction generation failed` and the system will fall back to the rule-based messages.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

PulseGrid is a functional monitoring platform with the following known limitations:

- **Email Verification**: The authentication system currently allows sign-up without email verification. This was a deliberate trade-off to focus on core monitoring features.

- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting is implemented for the public status endpoint only. Comprehensive rate limiting across all endpoints is recommended for high-traffic deployments.

- **Load Balancer**: The Network Load Balancer is configured but not currently routing traffic. The system uses direct ECS task IPs for connectivity.

- **Test Coverage**: Limited automated test coverage. Manual testing has been performed, but comprehensive test suites are recommended.

- **PDF Reports**: PDF export is planned but not yet implemented. CSV export is available.

These limitations do not impact the core functionality of the monitoring platform and can be addressed as the platform evolves.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- Enhanced email verification system
- Comprehensive API rate limiting
- PDF report export
- Additional notification channels (SMS, Slack, webhooks) - code exists but not fully tested/configured
- Enhanced test coverage
- Load balancer configuration improvements
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom alert rules and conditions
- GraphQL API support (optional)
- Multi-cloud support (optional)

## 🔒 Security

### Security Features Implemented

- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS policies to prevent unauthorized access
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries using prepared statements
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Organization-based data separation at the application level
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation using Go validators and request binding
- **AWS Secrets Management**: SSM Parameter Store for secure secret storage
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables, never committed to version control

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**: All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate JWT secrets**: Change JWT secrets regularly, especially if exposed
3. **Use strong passwords**: Enforce password complexity requirements
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update Go modules and npm packages
5. **Database security**: Use strong database passwords and restrict network access
6. **AWS IAM**: Follow principle of least privilege for AWS credentials
7. **Regular audits**: Review access logs and monitor for suspicious activity
